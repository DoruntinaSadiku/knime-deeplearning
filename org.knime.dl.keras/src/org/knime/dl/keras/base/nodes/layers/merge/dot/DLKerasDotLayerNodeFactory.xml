	<name>Keras Dot Layer</name>

	<shortDescription>
		A layer that computes a dot product between samples in two inputs.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A layer that computes a dot product between samples in two inputs.
			Corresponds to the
			<a href="https://keras.io/layers/merge/#dot">Dot Keras layer</a>
			. The axis along which to calculate the dot product must be of the same size for both inputs.
		</intro>
		<option name="Name prefix">
			The name prefix of the layer. The prefix is complemented by an index suffix to obtain a unique layer name. If this option is unchecked, the name prefix is derived from the layer type.
		</option>
		<option name="Axes">
			A comma separated pair of integers that specifies along which axis to compute the dot product.
			Note that axis 0 is the batch axis.
		</option>
		<option name="Normalize">
			Whether to L2-normalize samples along the dot product axis before taking the dot product.
			If selected, then the output of the dot product is the cosine proximity between the two samples.
		</option>
